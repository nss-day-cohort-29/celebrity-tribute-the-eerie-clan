    <h1> The tip of the Bowie Berg...</h1>

        <p>  David Bowie was born in South London's Brixton neighborhood on 
            January 8, 1947. His first hit was the song "Space Oddity" in 1969.
             The original pop chameleon, Bowie became a fantastical sci-fi character 
             for his breakout Ziggy Stardust album. He later co-wrote "Fame" with 
             Carlos Alomar and John Lennon, which became his first American No. 1 
             single in 1975. An accomplished actor, Bowie starred in The Man Who 
             Fell to Earth in 1976. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
             Fame in 1996. Shortly after releasing his final album, Bowie died from 
             cancer on January 10, 2016. </p>
